            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>He was born in <strong>Negotin.</strong> From the birthplace of his parents he drew the second last name <i>Mokranjac</i> (literally: resident of Mokranje).<br>
                He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the natural science and mathematics section of the University of Belgrade.<br>
                In 1879 he traveled to Munich where he studied music in the class of Josef Rheinberger. <br>
                After a brief break, he continued to study in Rome in the class of Parisotti, in 1884. Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of the Kornelije Stanković choir of Belgrade.<br>
                From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in Leipzig, Germany. Upon his return to Serbia in 1887 he became the conductor of the Belgrade singing society (Belgrade Choir).<br>
                From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the Belgrade high school, and in 1901 transferred to Bogoslovija (Belgrade Theological College) where he taught church singing.<br>
                Together with Stanislav Binički and Cvetko Manojlović, Mokranjac founded the first independent music school in 1899 - Serbian Music School in Belgrade.<br>
                He remains the director of this school until his death. Today the school bears his name. His work as a melograph bore many transcriptions of thus far unwritten folk songs.<hr>
